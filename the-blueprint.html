  <!-- Main Content -->
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
        <p>There&rsquo;s a lot of self-help and personal development resources out there. Some of can be profoundly
          life-changing when applied. But when there is so much material, so much content, where do we start? What order
          should we learn skills in? How should we prioritize them? The below is a &ldquo;game manual&rdquo; or
          blueprint that may help you on your journey.</p>
        <p>This is a step by step process that I have personally followed, and one that I have recognized the teachers I
          have learnt from have followed too. All of the key resources are included in this document, as well as my
          personal thoughts on the best way to implement the various techniques.</p>
        <p>It is important to remember that this is a life-long journey. At the time of writing, I have been working on
          personal development for 7 years, the detailed steps below that I have followed have had an immensely
          positive impact on my well-being, state of mine, internal and external world. However, there is much more to
          do, the journey never ends! With that being said, let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
        <p><strong>The foundations of a great life</strong></p>
        <p>The amazing thing about personal development work, is that the research has already been done for us!
          Psychologist Abraham Maslow published a paper in 1943 &ndash; &ldquo;A Theory of Human Motivation&rdquo;,
          which contained Maslow's hierarchy of needs. The aim of this guide is to get to the stage where we can work on
          deep self-actualization. According to Maslow, (and this is very easily to verify in your own experience and
          observations) we cannot work on self-actualization until we have satisfied our more fundamental needs. The
          below figure tells the entire story here, but I will go into more detail, if you&rsquo;re interested in
          reading
          more, click or tap the image for more articles.</p>

          <img class="blog-img" src="img/mazlows-needs.webp" />
        </a>
        <p>Some of these points may already be addressed in your own life, if so &ndash; that&rsquo;s great, tick it off
          and move on.</p>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s tackle the first stage &ndash; your physical needs. Just because you eat food and get some sleep
          doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you&rsquo;re meeting these needs. As with all of the material in this guide, it
          is meant to be a pointer &ndash; a map, not the territory. Bearing that in mind, I would strongly advise that
          you independently and extensively research each aspect. Having said that, following the key points below will
          ensure you meet your fundamental needs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Keep your
            alcohol intake low &ndash; 1 to 3 drinks per week</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Go to sleep
            and wake up at approximately the same time each day</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">
              </span></span><strong>Don&rsquo;t drink caffeine</strong>. This includes black tea, green tea, many soft
            drinks and of course coffee and energy drinks. Caffeine has a half life of around 8 hours. This means if you
            have a coffee at 10am containing 100mg of caffeine, at 6pm you will have around 50mg left in your
            bloodstream. <em>That </em>50mg now has a half life of another 6 &ndash; 8 hours, meaning at midnight
            &ndash; 2:00am you still have 25mg circulating. Drinking <em>any</em> caffeine will disrupt your sleep, one
            of the fundamental needs we are trying to address. If you are in the 95% of the population addicted to this
            psychoactive drug, I would recommend quitting cold turkey. If you really can&rsquo;t do this, calculate your
            intake per day in milligrams, buy a caffeine powder and some digital scales, use this as your only caffeine
            source, then reduce your intake by 1mg per day</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Don&rsquo;t
            use a screen (including your phone) for the last hour before bed. Replace with physical book reading,
            meditation or something else</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Eat a
            whole-food diet. This means minimizing processed foods and moderating your refined sugar intake. One of the
            most important aspects of this is totally avoiding any <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQmqVVmMB3k">vegetable oils</a></li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Drink
            plenty of water, ideally use a filtered water bottle and refill it several times per day</li>
        </ul>
