  <!-- Main Content -->
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
        <p>There&rsquo;s a lot of self-help and personal development resources out there. Some of can be profoundly
          life-changing when applied. But when there is so much material, so much content, where do we start? What order
          should we learn skills in? How should we prioritize them? The below is a &ldquo;game manual&rdquo; or
          blueprint that may help you on your journey.</p>
        <p>This is a step by step process that I have personally followed, and one that I have recognized the teachers I
          have learnt from have followed too. All of the key resources are included in this document, as well as my
          personal thoughts on the best way to implement the various techniques.</p>
        <p>It is important to remember that this is a life-long journey. At the time of writing, I have been working on
          personal development for 7 years, the detailed steps below that I have followed have had an immensely
          positive impact on my well-being, state of mine, internal and external world. However, there is much more to
          do, the journey never ends! With that being said, let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
        <p><strong>The foundations of a great life</strong></p>
        <p>The amazing thing about personal development work, is that the research has already been done for us!
          Psychologist Abraham Maslow published a paper in 1943 &ndash; &ldquo;A Theory of Human Motivation&rdquo;,
          which contained Maslow's hierarchy of needs. The aim of this guide is to get to the stage where we can work on
          deep self-actualization. According to Maslow, (and this is very easily to verify in your own experience and
          observations) we cannot work on self-actualization until we have satisfied our more fundamental needs. The
          below figure tells the entire story here, but I will go into more detail, if you&rsquo;re interested in
          reading
          more, click or tap the image for more articles.</p>
        <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=maslow%27s+hierarchy+of+needs" target="_blank">
          <img class="blog-img" src="img/mazlows-needs.webp" />
        </a>
        <p>Some of these points may already be addressed in your own life, if so &ndash; that&rsquo;s great, tick it off
          and move on.</p>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s tackle the first stage &ndash; your physical needs. Just because you eat food and get some sleep
          doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you&rsquo;re meeting these needs. As with all of the material in this guide, it
          is meant to be a pointer &ndash; a map, not the territory. Bearing that in mind, I would strongly advise that
          you independently and extensively research each aspect. Having said that, following the key points below will
          ensure you meet your fundamental needs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Keep your
            alcohol intake low &ndash; 1 to 3 drinks per week</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Go to sleep
            and wake up at approximately the same time each day</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">
              </span></span><strong>Don&rsquo;t drink caffeine</strong>. This includes black tea, green tea, many soft
            drinks and of course coffee and energy drinks. Caffeine has a half life of around 8 hours. This means if you
            have a coffee at 10am containing 100mg of caffeine, at 6pm you will have around 50mg left in your
            bloodstream. <em>That </em>50mg now has a half life of another 6 &ndash; 8 hours, meaning at midnight
            &ndash; 2:00am you still have 25mg circulating. Drinking <em>any</em> caffeine will disrupt your sleep, one
            of the fundamental needs we are trying to address. If you are in the 95% of the population addicted to this
            psychoactive drug, I would recommend quitting cold turkey. If you really can&rsquo;t do this, calculate your
            intake per day in milligrams, buy a caffeine powder and some digital scales, use this as your only caffeine
            source, then reduce your intake by 1mg per day</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Don&rsquo;t
            use a screen (including your phone) for the last hour before bed. Replace with physical book reading,
            meditation or something else</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Eat a
            whole-food diet. This means minimizing processed foods and moderating your refined sugar intake. One of the
            most important aspects of this is totally avoiding any <a class="link-highlight" target="_blank"
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQmqVVmMB3k">vegetable oils</a></li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Drink
            plenty of water, ideally use a filtered water bottle and refill it several times per day</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Exercise
            for around an hour 3 &ndash; 4 times per week</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Take as long as you need to address these physical needs, they are crucial to maximizing your potential, you
          can&rsquo;t focus on deep, meaningful work if you don&rsquo;t feel as good as you possibly can physically.</p>
        <p>Now that you&rsquo;re feeling great, it&rsquo;s time to address your need for security, stability and freedom
          from fear. So many people, even those with well-paying careers, live in a state of underlying fear. Many have
          a few months of savings at most, meaning they are in constant fear of losing their job, losing their income,
          or suffering some other kind of financial burden that would leave them in a state of desperation. Why is this?
          Consumerism and materialism are largely to blame.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s worth reading about planned and perceived obsolescence to further understand this, but in short -
          planned obsolescence is the sadly common practice that companies utilize to ensure a product becomes hard, or
          impossible, to use after a few years of use. Apple are a great example of this &ndash; they will provide
          customers with a one year warranty, meanwhile they build in non-replaceable batteries that greatly diminish in
          efficiency after that first year. Apple have sued independent repair shops and Tesla have gone the same way,
          servicing their vehicles at an independent garage can now void your warranty. The logic behind this, is that
          when you take your product to a &ldquo;certified&rdquo; repair shop, the repair is usually extortionately
          expensive, leading most people to decide it&rsquo;s just easier to buy a new product&hellip; great news for
          the company in question!</p>
        <p>Cars, tech and fashion are the main industries that utilize intentional obsolescence. They also employ
          "perceived obsolescence" as a technique, where they make old tech or clothing seem uncool or antique. People
          use these products as status symbols so are easily swayed into buying the newest model. A great video that
          covers this in more detail can be found <a class="link-highlight" target="_blank"
            href="https://youtu.be/wzWU7D0S9_8">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Reading more about minimalist philosophy, (not the trendy, social media version of minimalism!) will set you
          on a totally paradigm-shifting mindset when it comes to how you spend your money. <a class="link-highlight"
            target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/vPBlDD_8WNE">This video</a> is a great start. <a
            class="link-highlight" target="_blank"
            href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/">The Mr.
            Money Moustache blog</a> contains pretty much all of the information you will ever need about managing your
          finances and completely redefining the way you spend and invest your money. To summarize - we want to rid
          ourselves of, in the words of Philosopher Alain de Botton &ndash; &ldquo;<em>The constant tension or fear of
            being perceived as &lsquo;unsuccessful&rsquo; by the society in materialistic terms</em>&rdquo;.</p>
        <p><em>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t earn enough money to save or invest, I&rsquo;ll never be financially
            independent!&rdquo; </em>I hear you say.</p>
        <p>A common objection, and fortunately a simple one to overcome. In Japanese philosophy, there is a term known
          as Ikigai. This is the secret to developing financial independence, whilst cultivating meaning and joy from
          your daily work, as shown below.</p>
        <img class="blog-img" src="img/ikigai.jpeg" />
        <p>The way to achieve this is to develop a valuable skill that is in demand, that pays well, that you enjoy and
          have a passion for and that you can get good at. There are many career paths that you can take that do not
          involve going to university or paying for expensive courses, I know this because I personally chose one. After
          university, I had no idea what to do with my career, so I researched jobs that pay well that can be
          self-taught. I found and fell in love with computer programming and software development. Since that time,
          only 7 years ago, I have tripled my salary, saved 2 years of living expenses, have paid off half a mortgage
          and have solid investments in various stocks, funds and cryptocurrency. I&rsquo;m not telling you this to
          brag, I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;rich&rdquo; by high-western standards, I live in a modest 2 bedroom bungalow in the
          country, drive a 17 year old car and I&rsquo;m not a special talent in my field. However, what I have
          done is work almost every day on developing the skills related to software development, have read extensively
          about investing and personal finance and have implemented the techniques. It&rsquo;s actually all pretty easy,
          as long as you are consistent, I believe anyone can achieve the same results.</p>
        <p>So the first step in this process is finding something you love and have a passion for. Maybe it&rsquo;s in
          IT, the arts, conservation, charity work, the service industry or something totally new. Like myself, you may
          well not know what this is until you try it out. You will need to experiment, but remember that passion and
          motivation is like a old well pump. The first few pumps are &ldquo;primers&rdquo;, you won&rsquo;t get any
          water at first. But once the pump is primed, you will get water with each pump. This is exactly how motivation
          and passion works, you need to prime yourself by developing competence in a skill before you can become
          passionate about it.</p>
        <p>A useful technique for finding your passion is asking yourself what you like, what you love and what you
          don't like. After you have a list of things, ask yourself <em>why</em> you like or love certain things and
          what the elements are that contribute to this. Search for patterns or connections to discover potential
          passions. Also learn about "flow". What gets you into that state? This could be a big pointer.</p>
        <p>You don&rsquo;t need to spend long working on your skill before either applying for a junior position in your
          field (I did this 2 months into learning programming, specifically JavaScript, I completely flunked the
          technical interview, but they hired me due to my enthusiasm and desire to learn), or starting your own
          business.</p>
        <p>So, once you have developed the basics in a skill you have chosen, apply for positions as a junior or start
          your own business using that skill. After gaining around 2 years of professional experience, you will be much
          more competent and in a position to use the skill in higher paying positions. Once you have a decent income,
          start to invest regularly (monthly) in assets such as ethical funds &amp; stocks. Research the effects of
          compounding interest if you need inspiration for why this is a great thing to do. Again, the <a
            class="link-highlight" target="_blank"
            href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/">Mr
            Money Moustache blog</a> covers this in great detail. Also ensure you save at least 6 &ndash; 12 months of
          living expenses as an emergency fund. This ensures you always have the flexibility to deal with jobs or
          situations you want to leave, without being tied down by lack of financial freedom.</p>
        <p>Ok, so at this stage, you&rsquo;ll have a career, not just a job. This is a wonderful start. There are a few
          simple habits to add to our &ldquo;foundations&rdquo; stage, before we can move on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have a daily meditation routine. Meditate at a regular time, initially for 15 - 20 minutes. This will
            start you on the path to looking inward, recognizing and getting to know your own mind and feeling more calm
          </li>
          <li>Spend some time outdoors / in nature every day if possible</li>
          <li>At the end of each day, write down or digitally log at least 3 things that you are grateful for. This
            habit alone will have a huge difference on your outlook and mood with a matter of weeks, don&rsquo;t skip
            this!</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Post-foundation &amp; breaking free of the social matrix</strong></p>
        <p>Coming soon&hellip;</p>
