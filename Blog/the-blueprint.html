        <p>There&rsquo;s a lot of self-help and personal development resources out there. Some of them can be profoundly
          life-changing when applied. But when there is so much material, so much content, where do we start? What order
          should we learn skills in? How should we prioritize them? The below is a &ldquo;game manual&rdquo; or
          blueprint that may help you on your journey.</p>
        <p>This is a step by step process that I have personally followed, and one that I have recognized the teachers I
          have learnt from have followed too. All of the key resources are included in this document, as well as my
          personal thoughts on the best way to implement the various techniques.</p>
        <p>It is important to remember that this is a life-long journey. At the time of writing, I have been working on
          personal development for 7 years. The detailed steps below that I have followed have had an immensely
          positive impact on my well-being, state of mine, internal and external world. However, there is much more to
          do, the journey never ends! With that being said, let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
        <p><strong>The foundations of a great life</strong></p>
        <p>The amazing thing about personal development work is that the research has already been done for us!
          Psychologist Abraham Maslow published a paper in 1943 &ndash; &ldquo;A Theory of Human Motivation&rdquo;,
          which contained Maslow's hierarchy of needs. The aim of this guide is to get to the stage where we can work on
          deep self-actualization. According to Maslow, (and this is very easily to verify in your own experience and
          observations) we cannot work on self-actualization until we have satisfied our more fundamental needs. The
          below figure tells the entire story here, but I will go into more detail, if you&rsquo;re interested in
          reading
          more, click or tap the image for more articles.</p>
        <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=maslow%27s+hierarchy+of+needs" target="_blank">
          <img class="blog-img" src="img/mazlows-needs.webp" />
        </a>
        <p>Some of these points may already be addressed in your own life, if so &ndash; that&rsquo;s great, tick it off
          and move on.</p>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s tackle the first stage &ndash; your physical needs. Just because you eat food and get some sleep
          doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you&rsquo;re meeting these needs. As with all of the material in this guide, it
          is meant to be a pointer &ndash; a map, not the territory. Bearing that in mind, I would strongly advise that
          you independently and extensively research each aspect. Having said that, following the key points below will
          ensure you meet your fundamental needs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Keep your
            alcohol intake low &ndash; 1 to 3 drinks per week</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Go to sleep
            and wake up at approximately the same time each day</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">
              </span></span><strong>Don&rsquo;t drink caffeine</strong>. This includes black tea, green tea, many soft
            drinks and of course coffee and energy drinks. Caffeine has a half life of around 8 hours. This means if you
            have a coffee at 10am containing 100mg of caffeine, at 6pm you will have around 50mg left in your
            bloodstream. <em>That </em>50mg now has a half life of another 6 &ndash; 8 hours, meaning at midnight
            &ndash; 2:00am you still have 25mg circulating. Drinking <em>any</em> caffeine will disrupt your sleep, one
            of the fundamental needs we are trying to address. If you are in the 95% of the population addicted to this
            psychoactive drug, I would recommend quitting cold turkey. If you really can&rsquo;t do this, calculate your
            intake per day in milligrams, buy a caffeine powder and some digital scales, use this as your only caffeine
            source, then reduce your intake by 1mg per day</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Don&rsquo;t
            use a screen (including your phone) for the last hour before bed. Replace with physical book reading,
            meditation or something else</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Eat a
            whole-food diet. This means minimizing processed foods and moderating your refined sugar intake. One of the
            most important aspects of this is totally avoiding any <a class="link-highlight" target="_blank"
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQmqVVmMB3k">vegetable oils</a></li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Drink
            plenty of water, ideally use a filtered water bottle and refill it several times per day</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Exercise
            for around an hour 3 &ndash; 4 times per week</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Take as long as you need to address these physical needs, they are crucial to maximizing your potential. You
          can&rsquo;t focus on deep, meaningful work if you don&rsquo;t feel as good as you possibly can physically.</p>
        <p>Now that you&rsquo;re feeling great, it&rsquo;s time to address your need for security, stability and freedom
          from fear. So many people, even those with well-paying careers, live in a state of underlying fear. Many have
          a few months of savings at most, meaning they are in constant fear of losing their job, losing their income,
          or suffering some other kind of financial burden that would leave them in a state of desperation. Why is this?
          Consumerism and materialism are largely to blame.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s worth reading about planned and perceived obsolescence to further understand this, but in short -
          planned obsolescence is the sadly common practice that companies utilize to ensure a product becomes hard, or
          impossible, to use after a few years of use. Apple is a great example of this &ndash; they will provide
          customers with a one year warranty, meanwhile they build in non-replaceable batteries that greatly diminish in
          efficiency after that first year. Apple have sued independent repair shops and Tesla have gone the same way,
          servicing their vehicles at an independent garage can now void your warranty. The logic behind this is that
          when you take your product to a &ldquo;certified&rdquo; repair shop, the repair is usually extortionately
          expensive, leading most people to decide it&rsquo;s just easier to buy a new product&hellip; great news for
          the company in question!</p>
        <p>Cars, tech and fashion are the main industries that utilize intentional obsolescence. They also employ
          "perceived obsolescence" as a technique, where they make old tech or clothing seem uncool or antique. People
          use these products as status symbols so are easily swayed into buying the newest model. A great video that
          covers this in more detail can be found <a class="link-highlight" target="_blank"
            href="https://youtu.be/wzWU7D0S9_8">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Reading more about minimalist philosophy, (not the trendy, social media version of minimalism!) will set you
          on a totally paradigm-shifting mindset when it comes to how you spend your money. <a class="link-highlight"
            target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/vPBlDD_8WNE">This video</a> is a great start. <a
            class="link-highlight" target="_blank"
            href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/">The Mr.
            Money Moustache blog</a> contains pretty much all of the information you will ever need about managing your
          finances and completely redefining the way you spend and invest your money. To summarize - we want to rid
          ourselves of, in the words of Philosopher Alain de Botton &ndash; &ldquo;<em>The constant tension or fear of
            being perceived as &lsquo;unsuccessful&rsquo; by the society in materialistic terms</em>&rdquo;.</p>
        <p><em>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t earn enough money to save or invest, I&rsquo;ll never be financially
            independent!&rdquo; </em>I hear you say.</p>
        <p>A common objection, and fortunately a simple one to overcome. In Japanese philosophy, there is a term known
          as Ikigai. This is the secret to developing financial independence, whilst cultivating meaning and joy from
          your daily work, as shown below.</p>
        <img class="blog-img" src="img/ikigai.jpeg" />
        <p>The way to achieve this is to develop a valuable skill that is in demand, that pays well, that you enjoy and
          have a passion for and that you can get good at. There are many career paths that you can take that do not
          involve going to university or paying for expensive courses, I know this because I personally chose one. After
          university, I had no idea what to do with my career, so I researched jobs that pay well that can be
          self-taught. I found and fell in love with computer programming and software development. Since that time,
          only 7 years ago, I have tripled my salary, saved 2 years of living expenses, have paid off half a mortgage
          and have solid investments in various stocks, funds and cryptocurrency. I&rsquo;m not telling you this to
          brag, I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;rich&rdquo; by high-western standards, I live in a modest 2 bedroom bungalow in the
          country, drive a 17 year old car and I&rsquo;m not a special talent in my field. However, what I have
          done is work almost every day on developing the skills related to software development, have read extensively
          about investing and personal finance and have implemented the techniques. It&rsquo;s actually all pretty easy,
          as long as you are consistent, I believe anyone can achieve the same results.</p>
        <p>So the first step in this process is finding something you love and have a passion for. Maybe it&rsquo;s in
          IT, the arts, conservation, charity work, the service industry or something totally new. Like myself, you may
          well not know what this is until you try it out. You will need to experiment, but remember that passion and
          motivation is like a old well pump. The first few pumps are &ldquo;primers&rdquo;, you won&rsquo;t get any
          water at first. But once the pump is primed, you will get water with each pump. This is exactly how motivation
          and passion works, you need to prime yourself by developing competence in a skill before you can become
          passionate about it.</p>
        <p>A useful technique for finding your passion is asking yourself what you like, what you love and what you
          don't like. After you have a list of things, ask yourself <em>why</em> you like or love certain things and
          what the elements are that contribute to this. Search for patterns or connections to discover potential
          passions. Also learn about "flow". What gets you into that state? This could be a big pointer.</p>
        <p>You don&rsquo;t need to spend long working on your skill before either applying for a junior position in your
          field (I did this 2 months into learning programming, specifically JavaScript, I completely flunked the
          technical interview, but they hired me due to my enthusiasm and desire to learn), or starting your own
          business.</p>
        <p>So, once you have developed the basics in a skill you have chosen, apply for positions as a junior or start
          your own business using that skill. After gaining around 2 years of professional experience, you will be much
          more competent and in a position to use the skill in higher paying positions. Once you have a decent income,
          start to invest regularly (monthly) in assets such as ethical funds &amp; stocks. Research the effects of
          compounding interest if you need inspiration for why this is a great thing to do. Again, the <a
            class="link-highlight" target="_blank"
            href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/">Mr
            Money Moustache blog</a> covers this in great detail. Also ensure you save at least 6 &ndash; 12 months of
          living expenses as an emergency fund. This ensures you always have the flexibility to deal with jobs or
          situations you want to leave, without being tied down by lack of financial freedom.</p>
        <p>Ok, so at this stage, you&rsquo;ll have a career, not just a job. This is a wonderful start. There are a few
          simple habits to add to our &ldquo;foundations&rdquo; stage, before we can move on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have a daily meditation routine. Meditate at a regular time, initially for 15 - 20 minutes. This will
            start you on the path to looking inward, recognizing and getting to know your own mind and feeling more calm
          </li>
          <li>Spend some time outdoors / in nature every day if possible</li>
          <li>At the end of each day, write down or digitally log at least 3 things that you are grateful for. This
            habit alone will have a huge difference on your outlook and mood with a matter of weeks, don&rsquo;t skip
            this!</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Post-foundation &amp; breaking free of the social matrix</strong></p>
        <p>The foundation stage will have taken a lot of work, but by this point you should be able to reflect back to
          the &ldquo;pre-foundation&rdquo; stage of your life and notice many significant, positive and amazing changes.
          But that was just the tip of the iceberg!</p>
        <p>We need to set up a way to track our progress moving forward, a master journal that will log thoughts,
          insights and hard data. My recommendation is to use cloud-based documents with a folder system. Examples of
          this are Google Drive and Microsoft OneNote. The key features you want are a global search function, so that
          you can quickly find things and a way to categorize everything (folders and sub-folders).</p>
        <p>I recommend making a document about each subject and sub-domain as you develop through them, make notes and a
          master list of key concepts that you can continuously refer to and refine as you move forward. You will also
          want to track things like savings and investments, skill investments (perhaps the number of hours you have
          spent working on a particular skill), to help keep you on track and serve as a source of motivation.</p>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s a recommended set of documents you may wish to consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>A list of

            and meet financial goals</li>

            &ldquo;career&rdquo; folder that will contain various documents related to your career. This can include
            notes on technical or practical skills, certificates, learning resources and of course, an up-to-date
            r&eacute;sum&eacute; / CV</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>A master
            document that contains the most important lessons from all of the above that you can refer to as a
            &ldquo;cheat sheet&rdquo; for retaining your notes and lessons over time</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>That&rsquo;s so much work! </em>Yep! And it will be totally worth it. You don&rsquo;t need to do this all
          at once, create each document as you go and as you study each subject. Ideally spend time learning each one in
          a lot of depth before moving on. The key resources list at the end of this guide will contain much of what
          you need to accomplish this.</p>
        <p>Now that your documents are ready to use, let&rsquo;s start learning! Below is a list of thoughts,
          introspections and subjects that you will need to learn about in depth to break free of the &ldquo;social
          matrix&rdquo;, i.e. overcome your cultural and social conditioning. Why would you want to do this? In short,
          to discover truth in an absolute sense. Every worldview, opinion and even memory you and I hold are hugely
          skewed by our upbringings and our own biases. Don&rsquo;t you find it suspicious that what you consider to be
          &ldquo;right&rdquo;, &ldquo;moral&rdquo;, &ldquo;true" or even factual, coincidentally and conveniently adhere
          to that of the society you are based in right now?</p>
        <p>Consider this for a moment, in 99% of cases the devout Muslim or Christian will have been raised in a Muslim
          or Christian culture and family. The devout scientist will surround themselves with other materialist,
          rational, left-brain thinkers. The exclusive house-husband or house-wife will live in a society that almost
          exclusively practices monogamy, (a relatively recent tradition). The person with the latest smartphone and
          clothes will live in a consumerist, monetary society. Even the skeptic will surround themselves (usually
          virtually, online) with other &ldquo;skeptics&rdquo;, all the while forgetting to be sceptical about their own
          scepticism.</p>
        <p>Hopefully these ideas have at least opened your mind to the possibility that what you consider right or true,
          isn&rsquo;t so and that you have a lot of opening up to do. With that in mind, here is the list, search for
          each one independently, use the resources I have provided and read one or more books on each topic. This will
          potentially take months or even years, but with each subject you will chip away a little more at your biases
          and current idea of &ldquo;self&rdquo;. This will have a profound impact on your life in practical, spiritual
          and external ways.</p>

            the skill of action. Start and then learn how to do it! This is one of the most important practical lessons
            / skills you can learn and the one most people miss. Talking about your intentions, writing them down or
            fantasizing about them can be useful and motivating, but it means nothing if you don&rsquo;t take big
            action. Tony Robbins is a great motivator in this field, I&rsquo;d recommend his books, or at least watch
            some speeches of his, where he discusses taking massive action in more depth</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Research
            and learn about consumerism, planned &amp; perceived obsolescence, how social media and modern applications,

            your awareness and don't succumb to the techniques!</li>

            physical fitness beyond just exercising for the sake of being in shape. Develop a physical skill that has a
            side effect of keeping you in great shape. Examples include martial arts such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu,
            rock-climbing, surfing and many, many more!</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Learn about
            relationships and how to develop and sustain healthy and loving ones, research and learn about all the
            different types of relationships that are possible, i.e. monogamy, polyamory, open relationships, being
            single, relationship anarchy, etc. Experiment with different types of relationships in an ethical,
            consensual way, to discover who you are and what works for you. Important note here, don't assume that you
            need to be in a relationship all the time! Learn to love yourself and your own company</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Learn about
            the ways you affect the world, especially around climate change and waste (including carbon waste). Travel
            the world and explore different cultures and lifestyles, but be mindful of the impact you have. Travel in an
            environmentally friendly way, research the most and least carbon-heavy ways to travel and make choices
            accordingly</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Research

            that cover this
            topic. This is very practical as it will affect where you choose to live, raise children, how you travel,
            what travelling devices you do or don't own, etc. This ties into being more conscious of how you affect the
            world around you</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Develop a
            fulfilling and healthy social network. You can do this using apps such as Meetup, attending social events,

            doing all this work, be aware of being present and mindful. Don't spend every waking minute on research

        <p>Every single point in the &ldquo;Post-Foundation&rdquo; stage can, and probably should take a significant
          amount of time to cover. Don&rsquo;t just read the list and move on, save the list somewhere and work through
          it. If you truly study and embody each topic in depth, it will take years before you get to this stage. The
          rest of these concepts are advanced and couldn&rsquo;t possibly be covered in one lifetime, it is a list to
          work through indefinitely, embracing the joy of the journey. At this stage there should be a radical shift in
          focus from outcomes to the intrinsic love of the process. With that being said, let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>

        <p>Obviously these videos are just a start, an entry point. Do your own research and exploration after getting
          through these to find more ideas that resonate with you. A quick word of warning here though, be sure to
          actually implement the ideas in each one! If you just binge watch content, without making any notes, without
          reflecting on the content and without making any changes, you won&rsquo;t get the results you&rsquo;re hoping
          for (see the last video in the list for more on that).</p>
        <p>The second list is what I consider essential reading, these books have had an indescribable impact on my way
          of thinking and overall psyche. I won&rsquo;t include any links as it would be great if you can find them
          pre-owned, ideally buying new as a last resort.</p>

            affiliate links, I make no money from this or from any of the links contained within it. This is my best
            attempt, based on my experiences so far, at writing something that would serve as a lifelong guide to anyone
            that is willing to put in the work required. If I had to leave a small child with one thing, one
            consolidated manual to life, well this would be my offering to them. Most people reading this will be much
            older than a child, but remember it&rsquo;s never, ever too late &ndash; as Mr. Wordsworth so brilliantly
            put it &ndash; &ldquo;<em>To begin, begin</em>&rdquo;.</span></p>
