                    <p>I had the pleasure of working closely with Marlon for some time on the development of my organisation’s website, providing digital services to our external users and internal staff, and most recently on integrating this into our wider technical landscape. I was particularly impressed by Marlon’s ability to cut through and clarify complex integration requirements, especially where limited contextual information had been provided. He is also skilled at managing client relationships effectively: he has built a strong partnership with our team, and is a trusted technical advisor.</p>

                    <p>I’ve had the pleasure of working with Marlon for three years now, most
                        recently as my team lead.
                        As a team lead he was closely involved with everybody in the team, bringing out the best in
                        people and encouraging them to reach their goals. He is an excellent communicator and is able to
                        break down complex problems into digestible chunks. Marlon is also highly technical and still
                        gets involved in development work alongside leading the team. Well versed in Agile
                        methodologies, he helped transition one of our projects to this way of working, including
                        guiding the client. Everything considered, any employee would be lucky to have Marlon as their
                        team lead.</p>

                    <p>Marlon has been my team leader for the last three years. It has been nothing but a pleasure to
                        work with him both professionally and at an individual level. He has great communication skills
                        and is also has many years of experience in technology. But more importantly able to close the
                        gap between communicating difficult technical requirements to the client in a way that they
                        understand. In those three years I have been with him, he did a fantastic job catering to the 5
                        plus developers and the needs of the client. Overall, a great person with an unmatched positive
                        attitude and leadership skills that doesn’t crack under pressure. He would be a great addition
                        to any team.</p>
