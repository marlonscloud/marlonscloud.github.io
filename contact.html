        <h2>Web & Application Development</h2>
        <p>Whether you need a website or web application built from the ground up, or have an existing project that needs additional features, I can help. I aim to provide clients with a complete package that can be mostly self-maintained upon completion. This can be achieved by various means, including utilization of Content Management Systems, writing clean, maintainable code and by working closely with you to ensure all implementations are appropriate for your project. For more detail about my experience and skills, take a look at my <a href="cv.html" target="blank">resume</a>.</p>

        <h2>User Experience</h2>
        <p>A good user experience involves taking a user through a journey and telling a story along the way. I focus on having a deep understanding of potential user, their needs, what they (and you) value and also their abilities and possible limitations. By obtaining an understanding of these factors, projects can be tailored for the users, whilst still achieving organizational goals and objectives. I have extensive experience in first-hand and reported user research, usability evaluations, accessibility auditing and project management, all of which will aid you in optimizing your users’ experience. <a class="email-link--black" href = "mailto: marlonscloud@gmail.com">Email me</a> to find out more!</p>

        <h2>Code Quality & Security Audits</h2>
        <p>Software developers often have strict deadlines and pressures to deliver quality within allocated sprints. Unfortunately the time given is not always sufficient, and when time is limited, it’s often security, testing and code quality that are of the first to suffer. Reducing risk and technical debt in existing code-bases is critical to the long-term success of any web application. By conducting an initial investigation, followed by follow-up testing and reviews, I am able to reduce your risk, improve the efficiency and maintainability of your code, whilst ensuring code is in line with current best practices.</p>

        <h2>Accessibility Audits</h2>
        <p>According to the World Health Organization, there are currently around 285 million users who cannot read all content on websites, due to various disabilities, such as those suffering with low vision or blindness. We should all aim to make valuable content accessible and available to all users, but doing so requires careful design and technical considerations. I am experienced in both auditing and fixing accessibility issues on websites and web applications. Once you have a structure and some principles to follow, along with some useful tools, this is a fairly easy area to maintain.</p>

        <h2>Voluntary mentoring (programming & software development)</h2>
        <p>I have been a software developer for several years now, I made my start as a junior SQL developer in January 2015. Before that I had worked in IT in various forms, but had never written any code. I was in a low-paying job and had just graduated university, with no idea on my life direction. I decided to take control and took some online (free) courses and started experimenting with various code by myself at home. After two weeks of doing this, I applied for my first job as a developer and got it. Since then I have become a successful full-stack developer that has a broad technical skill set, but with some specialisms that help me stand out and do well within a competitive field.</p>
        <p>A lot of people I work with have at least under-graduate, but often post-graduate degrees in computer-science or engineering, I do not. Whilst these are extremely useful paths, some people don’t have the opportunity to follow such paths, whether due to financial burdens or other life-circumstances, such as age or family obligations.</p>
        <p>I believe there are a great number of capable, smart people in the world that due to unfortunate life circumstances, are stuck in positions that don’t reward them adequately. If this is sounds like you, then please <a class="email-link--black" href = "mailto: marlonscloud@gmail.com">get in touch</a> – I want to give back to a field that has given me so much by teaching and mentoring those who deem it inaccessible to them. Even if you’ve never touched a line of code in your life, I believe with the right determination, anyone can develop any technical skill to the point it can reward them with a great life, if they’re willing to put the work in.</p>

        <h2>Voluntary French lessons & language learning mentoring</h2>
        <p>In 2015, I started teaching myself French, with no background the in the language at all. I’m currently at the European Language Framework B2 level. Whilst I’m not native-sounding, I have a good level of fluency and proficiency in the language that allows me to enjoy conversation, watch movies and play video games in French (without English subtitles obviously!) I have a strong passion for language learning and am happy to teach what I know to keen learners, or to practice existing skills with students.</p>

        <h2>Voluntary Guitar Lessons</h2>
        <p>I started playing guitar at the age of 14 in 2002. Since then, I have played in bands, played many live gigs, recorded albums and produced many guitar & music videos. I believe learning and mastering an instrument is an extremely rewarding experience and would like to give back some of what has been given to me by providing lessons online via video call to those who would otherwise not be able to access a teacher. I have taught guitar to students of all ages and abilities and can cover many styles of playing and expression. If you’d like to book a free lesson, please <a class="email-link--black" href = "mailto: marlonscloud@gmail.com">send me an email</a> telling me more about yourself and what/why you’d like to learn. Below is a brief sample of my playing.</p>
